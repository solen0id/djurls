# djurls - A simple Django URL Shortener

This is a small sample project to showcase some of the things I learned while working
with Django and DRF.

## What is it?

You are looking at djurls, a simple **Dj**ango **URL** **S**hortener. Now you might be
thinking, "Gee, I hope the code is better than the name", but I guess you'll just have
to see that for yourself. This project is intended to showcase how easy it is to get up
and running with Django.

## How do I run it?

## How do I develop/test/extend it?
